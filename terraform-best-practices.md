# Terraform Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices we follow in our Terraform codebase to ensure maintainability, security, and operational excellence.

## Code Organization

### Modular Structure

Our Terraform code is organized in a modular structure:

```
terraform/
├── modules/             # Reusable components
├── environments/        # Environment-specific configurations
└── global/             # Shared resources across environments
```

This approach enables:
- **Reusability**: Common infrastructure patterns are defined once
- **Consistency**: Standardized configurations across environments
- **Isolation**: Changes to one environment don't affect others

### File Separation

Within each module or environment, files are separated by function:
- `main.tf`: Primary resource definitions
- `variables.tf`: Input variable declarations
- `outputs.tf`: Output value declarations
- `providers.tf`: Provider configuration
- Function-specific files (e.g., `network.tf`, `ecs.tf`)

## Version Control Practices

### Branching Strategy

- **Feature branches**: For new infrastructure components
- **Environment branches**: Protected branches for each environment
- **Main branch**: Protected, represents the current state of infrastructure

### Commit Guidelines

- **Atomic commits**: Each commit should represent a logical change
- **Descriptive messages**: Clear explanation of what changes and why
- **Include plan output**: Attach `terraform plan` output to pull requests

## Security Practices

### Secrets Management

- No hardcoded secrets in Terraform code
- Use of AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store
- IAM roles with least-privilege permissions

### State Management

- Remote state stored in S3 with encryption
- State locking with DynamoDB
- Limited access to state files

## Testing and Validation

### Local Testing

- LocalStack for local AWS service emulation
- Terraform validate for syntax checking
- Pre-commit hooks for format checking

### CI/CD Integration

- Automated plan in CI pipeline
- Plan approval before apply
- Post-apply validation tests

## Deployment Practices

### Terraform Workflow

1. Initialize: `terraform init`
2. Format: `terraform fmt`
3. Validate: `terraform validate`
4. Plan: `terraform plan -out=tfplan`
5. Apply: `terraform apply tfplan`

### Change Management

- **Peer reviews**: Required for all infrastructure changes
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs with infrastructure changes
- **Incremental changes**: Prefer small, manageable changes

## Infrastructure Drift Detection

- Regular execution of `terraform plan` to detect drift
- Automated drift detection in monitoring system
- Remediation process for unauthorized changes

## Documentation Standards

- README for each module explaining purpose and usage
- Input and output variable documentation
- Architecture diagrams for complex components

## Cost Optimization

- Resource tagging for cost allocation
- Regular review of provisioned resources
- Use of auto-scaling and right-sizing

## Handling LocalStack vs AWS Configuration

For managing the difference between local testing and production environments:

### Method 1: Environment Variables

```terraform
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
  
  # Production configuration
  dynamic "default_tags" {
    for_each = local.is_local_env ? [] : [1]
    content {
      tags = {
        Environment = var.environment
        Project     = var.project_name
        ManagedBy   = "terraform"
      }
    }
  }
  
  # LocalStack configuration
  dynamic "endpoints" {
    for_each = local.is_local_env ? [1] : []
    content {
      # LocalStack endpoints here
    }
  }
}
```

### Method 2: Separate Files with Symlinks

Maintain separate provider configurations and use symlinks or file copying as part of your workflow.

### Method 3: Terraform Workspaces

Use Terraform workspaces to switch between local and cloud environments.

By following these practices, we ensure our infrastructure is reliable, secure, and maintainable across all environments.
